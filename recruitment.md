# Scenarios
- When you're given a task and you have no idea about it, where do you start?
- One thing you feel you need improvement?
- "I wish they asked me this question because I could really impress them with it"

# Interviewee
- Is my role a replacement or a new position?
- What is the end to end process in a delivery? (Agile)
- How long would it take to
  - get the latest code base
  - compile locally
  - push code changes to a branch
  - see the changes on a staging environment
- How much control do I have on my workstation?
- How much direct access to I have to cloud services?
